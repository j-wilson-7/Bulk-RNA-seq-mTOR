# Bulk-RNA-seq-mTOR
 Bulk RNA-seq datasets to assess the impact of CRISPR/cas9 mTORC1 and mTORC2 knockouts and mTOR pharmacological inhibitors on the TGFbeta1 response in primary human lung fibroblasts  
 Dataset 1: CRISPR/Cas9 gene edited pHLFs targeting either mTORC1 or mTORC2  
 Dataset 2: Treatment with the dual mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 or the partial mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin  
- Two sets of DEseq2 analysis using complex design formula (interaction analysis)
- Figure generation for CTHRC1+ pathogenic fibroblasts publication, including dotplots, cnetplots, barplots
- Pathways analysis using ClusterProfiler, including visualisation using dotplots, cnetplots etc
